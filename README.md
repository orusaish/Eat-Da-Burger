# Eat-Da-Burger

### Overview

This app uses Handlebars, MySQL, Node, Express, and a homemade ORM to create a burger logger. I followed the MVC design pattern and Node to Query the route data for the app. Handlebars was used to generate all of my HTML.

- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

- Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page with customer.

- The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
